# SILD_Sim
Provides simulation code demonstrating how genetic correlations can emerge from the effects of correlational selection. A population in linkage equilibrium away from an optima will initially evolve a genetic correlation aligned with the landscape. If genetic variation is depleted while the population is still relatively far from the optima, a genetic correlatoin orthogonal to the landscape can evolve.
